Taking some notes on the board game "Scotland Yard", for analysis and distance
mapping.

The crucial file connections.txt represents locations thus:

ID conn [conn [conn...]]

Each connection consists of a type letter followed by the destination ID
(numeric). Type letters are 'r'ailway, 'b'us, and 't'axi.

Every connection should be referenced twice (for data integrity checking). The
resulting map should be a non-directed graph.

Connections should be grouped r,b,t and in ID order within each group.
