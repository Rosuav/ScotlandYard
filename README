Taking some notes on the board game "Scotland Yard", for analysis and distance
mapping.

The crucial file connections.txt represents locations thus:

ID conn [conn [conn...]]

Each connection consists of a type letter followed by the destination ID
(numeric). Type letters are 'r'ailway, 'b'us, and 't'axi. The ferry, being
available only on a black ticket, is ignored for the purposes of this graph;
if it is needed, its stops are (in sequence) 108-115-157-194.

Every connection should be referenced twice (for data integrity checking). The
resulting map should be a non-directed graph.

Connections should be grouped r,b,t and in ID order within each group.

Stats ideas:
* What's the best-connected location - that is, from here to anywhere on the
  board is no more than X, lowest possible X? - Done
* Which location has the greatest number of modes and the fewest destinations?
* Which two locations are topologically the furthest apart? - Done
* Which location is most central, based on average topological distance to all
  other locations? - Done
3 out of 4, not bad.
